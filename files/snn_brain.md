# SNN training frameworks

Open-source software to train spiking neural networks. In these the tools, the goal is to emulate the human brain as efficiently as possible, instead of optimizing neuron model and simulation for speeding up AI tasks.

[Brian](https://briansimulator.org/) is a free, open source simulator for spiking neural networks. It is written in the Python programming language and is available on almost all platforms. We believe that a simulator should not only save the time of processors, but also the time of scientists. Brian is therefore designed to be easy to learn and use, highly flexible and easily extensible.

## NEST

[NEST](https://www.nest-simulator.org/) is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the dynamics, size and structure of neural systems rather than on the exact morphology of individual neurons. The development of NEST is coordinated by the NEST Initiative.

NEST is ideal for networks of spiking neurons of any size, for example:

- models of information processing e.g. in the visual or auditory cortex of mammals,
- models of network activity dynamics, e.g. laminar cortical networks or balanced random networks,
- models of learning and plasticity.
