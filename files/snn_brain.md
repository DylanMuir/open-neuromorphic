# SNN training frameworks

Open-source software to train spiking neural networks. In these the tools, the goal is to emulate the human brain as efficiently as possible, instead of optimizing neuron model and simulation for speeding up AI tasks.

The Nengo Brain Maker is a Python package for building, testing, and deploying neural networks.

## Brian

[Brian](https://briansimulator.org/) is a free, open source simulator for spiking neural networks. It is written in the Python programming language and is available on almost all platforms. We believe that a simulator should not only save the time of processors, but also the time of scientists. Brian is therefore designed to be easy to learn and use, highly flexible and easily extensible.
