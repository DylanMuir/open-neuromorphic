# SNN training frameworks for ML

Open-source software to train spiking neural networks for ML tasks.

## snnTorch

![snntorch-image](../images/snntorch.png)

[snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch) is a SNN training framework for machine learning applications. It is focused on gradient-based training of SNNs. 
It is based on PyTorch for GPU acceleration and gradient computation. 

## Norse

[Norse](https://norse.github.io/norse/) aims at exploiting the advantages of bio-inspired neural components, which are sparse and event-driven - a fundamental difference from artificial neural networks. Norse expands PyTorch with primitives for bio-inspired neural components, bringing you two advantages: a modern and proven infrastructure based on PyTorch and deep learning-compatible spiking neural network components.

## Sinabs

[Sinabs](https://sinabs.readthedocs.io) is a deep learning library based on PyTorch for spiking neural networks, with a focus on simplicity, fast training and extendability. Sinabs works well for Vision models because of its support for weight transfer.

## Rockpool

[Rockpool](https://synsense.gitlab.io/rockpool/) is a Python package for working with dynamical neural network architectures, particularly for designing event-driven networks for Neuromorphic computing hardware. Rockpool provides a convenient interface for designing, training and evaluating recurrent networks, which can operate both with continuous-time dynamics and event-driven dynamics.

## BindsNET
