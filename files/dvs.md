# Dynamic vision sensors utilities

Open-source software to handle data generated by event-based cameras.

## Tonic

![tonic-image](../images/tonic.png)

[Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) is a tool to facilitate the download, manipulation and loading of event-based/spike-based data. It's like PyTorch Vision but for neuromorphic data!

## expelliarmus 

![expelliarmus-image](../images/expelliarmus.png)

[expelliarmus](https://github.com/fabhertz95/expelliarmus) is a Python/C package to decode binary files produced by Prophesee cameras. 

## AEStream - Address Event streaming library

[AEStream](https://github.com/norse/aestream) parses event-based dynamic-vision system (DVS) data from an input source and streams it to a sink (GPU, CPU, network ports...).

## AEDAT

[AEDAT](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/aedat) is a fast AEDAT 4 python reader, with a Rust underlying implementation.
