# Open Neuromorphic

It is well know that in deep learning and machine learning open-source is extremely diffused: the first projects that come to mind in that regard are [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Thanks to open-source, the machile learning community has grown tremendously in the last years. 

List of open source neuromorphic resources: SNN training frameworks, DVS handling routines and so on.

## List of resources

- SNN training frameworks aimed at development for [machine learning applications](files/snn_ml.md).
- SNN training frameworks aimed at development for [neuroscience applications](files/snn_brain.md).
- SNN training frameworks aimed at development for [for both neuroscience and ML applications](files/snn_misc.md).
- [DVS data handling](files/dvs.md).
- [digital](files/digital_hw.md) hardware.
- [mixed-signal](files/mixed_signal_hw.md) hardware.
